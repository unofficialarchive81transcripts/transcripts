<p>[BRIEF BURST OF MUSIC—TWANGY GUITAR, THEN TAPE DISTORTION.]</p>

<p>[THE SOUND OF A PHONE RINGING.]</p>

<p>[FINALLY, THE PHONE IS PICKED UP, BUT THERE IS NO VOICE ON THE OTHER END.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>Hello… is this Melody? Melody Pendras?</p>

<p>[PAUSE.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>Hello, Dan.</p>

<p>[PAUSE, UNBROKEN EXCEPT FOR A SLOW, SHAKY BREATH FROM DAN.]</p>

<p>Dan, I’m sure you have a lot of questions, and that’s perfectly normal. If I was in your position [CHUCKLES] I’d have some questions too. The work we’re doing is complex and doesn’t always lend itself to easy answers or explanations.</p>

<p>[DAN IS SILENT. PAUSE.]</p>

<p>Dan? You there, little buddy?</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>Okay. I’m done. I quit. You can’t keep me here, and I do not need this. I’m just going to take my shit, leave this goddamn building, and just—just go. I’m just gonna <em>go.</em></p>

<p>[DAN GETS UP AND BEGINS TO PACK HIS THINGS.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>I’d advise against that, Dan. I really would.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[CONTINUED RUSTLING.] Really? Because you can’t force me to stay, alright? This place is… it’s not normal. The lights keep flickering, and I keep hearing… and whatever that apartment building was… people disappeared, alright? Vanished from human memory. [SNIFFS.] And there are cults, and weird security guards, and teleportation, a-and I think some sort of evil museum.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>Are you done?</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[PACKING CONTINUES.] Like I said: I’m leaving.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>Dan. I’d like you to take a moment and <em>think</em> about what you feel right now, really think about it.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[CUTS HIM OFF WITH A HYSTERICAL, MIRTHLESS GIGGLE.] Well, I’m pretty angry right now, Mr. Davenport!</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>But beneath that. Really consider it.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>Hmm, uh… what am I feeling? What. Am. I. Feeling? Right now, I am feeling that you should go <em>fuck</em> yourself, Mr. Davenport.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>[SIGHS.] Well. There’s no need for vulgarity. And that’s really not what I’m getting at, Dan; that’s not what I’m talking about at all. Beneath all that, do you feel a slight tautness, a little bit of tugging?</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[CONTINUES TO PACK.] I have no idea what you’re talking about. [CALLING OFF-MIC] Ratty! Ratty! You wanna come with me? C’mon, the food’s much better outside.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>There’s a part of you—and it’s not a small part!—that’s grown accustomed to this place.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>Nope! Well, I don’t think Ratty’s coming, and I’ve packed up all my shit. So.. goodbye, Mr. Davenport; I hope to never hear from you again!</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>I <em>really</em> urge you to—</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[FOOTSTEPS.] I’m opening the door. You can’t stop me.</p>

<p>[BEEP. THE DOOR OPENS WITH A RUSTY, LOUD RUMBLING NOISE.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>[WORDS CUTTING THROUGH THE NOISE.] This is your home!</p>

<p>[PAUSE.]</p>

<p>You feel it, don’t you? A homesickness when you even begin to think about your life outside? Like strings are tying you to this building. If you don’t feel this, if you have no idea what I’m talking about, then walk through that door. Nothing’s stopping you. Just walk out. Away from the <em>truth</em> in this building. </p>

<p>[PAUSE.]</p>

<p>But. If you feel the way I think you do, then close the door. And we’ll try and figure this whole thing out. Together.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[EXHAUSTED.] Just… tell me w-what’s going on. [VOICE BREAKING] I’m still leaving after this though.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>Of course, Dan, no one’s forcing you to stay. [CONDESCENSION AND SMARMINESS RETURN.] You’re just a valued colleague, and we’d hate to lose you.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>Why don’t… why do I feel this way?</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>I don’t know, Dan. I-I really wish I did. Here’s what I’m thinking: you’re a natural storyteller, aren’tcha Dan? Didn’t you mention loving Radiolab or something in your cover letter? So when a natural storyteller like you hears something as <em>powerful</em> as what’s on those tapes, you get invested. And because you care so much about what happens, well, it’s difficult for you to leave without hearing the whole story.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>I don’t buy into that.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>You know what? That’s a completely reasonable reaction. Truth is, all I can guess is that God or the Universe or the Fate wants you to listen to those tapes. And it’s probably tough to ignore a higher calling.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[LAUGHS.] The… <em>universe</em> wants me to listen to those tapes? That’s your explanation?</em>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>Dan, maybe the way to look at this is not to try and probe down into why it’s difficult to leave. Perhaps a better mindset would be to forget about the… unusual aspects of your employment and just.. focus on doing your job to the best of your abilities. Kind of a Zen or Buddhist or something.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>You know what’s in these tapes, don’t you? Please, just—tell me <em>you</em> know.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>[BREATH.] We acknowledge that there are… certain.. documents... in the archive that can’t currently be explained by our modern understanding of science. Yet another reason you’re <em>uniquely</em> qualified, Dan—you’re an artist, a storyteller! You can understand things ona  really intuitive level without all that scientific mumbo-jumbo.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[SIGHS.] Thanks, I guess. And my section? Archive 81? The apartment… Visser?</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>[INCREDIBLY DISINGENUOUS SORROW.] All we want to know is what happened to those poor people in the Visser building. That’s why we put Melody’s number out on the web: to make sure anyone who was investigating her… disappearance.. came to us. We care deeply about our employees and former employees.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>So there was a—</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>A tragedy. But I don’t wanna prejudice your archival process. I believe you said that you value the “unbiased nature of the documentarian” in your interview? Or something. You’re doing a great job cataloging all of it, by the way. Really great stuff. Stellar work. Someone has to go through all this data, right? When we rediscovered it—well, let’s just say that we’re glad that this is all in your capable hands.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>Are we done here?</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>Dan, there’s no need to be defensive. But I understand your point of view; I’m sure this has been a stressful time for you. Also, before I forget, I need to reiterate the importance of you keeping that little recorder on, alright? After all, I think the lesson we can learn from the sad case of Melody Pendras is that it’s always best to have a record, just in case the worst happens. Not that the worst <em>will</em> happen. Knock on wood!</p>

<p>[A PAUSE.]</p>

<p>So are we on the same page, Dan? I think it’s really important that we’re of one mind on this.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[DULLY SARCASTIC.] Sounds really great, Mr. Davenport.</p>

<center><p><strong>DAVENPORT</strong></p></center>
<p>You take care of yourself, you hear? Buh-bye.</p>

<p>[THE PHONE IS HUNG UP.]</p>

<p>[A PAUSE, THEN CRASHING, THUDDING, AND HEAVY BREATHING. DAN GROANS AND SCREAMS OFF-MIC, TRYING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF.]</p>

<center><p><strong>RATTY</strong></p></center>
<p>[SQUEAKS.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>[LAUGHS.] Ratty! I was starting to worry about you. I could have left you all alone… and then who would’ve made you your favorite peach cobbler? Nobody.</p>

<p>[PAUSE. DAN SIGHS.]</p>

<p>C’mon, Ratty, don’t you want some?</p>

<center><p><strong>RATTY</strong></p></center>
<p>[PAUSES, THEN SQUEAKS.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>Fine. [SIGHS AGAIN.] Yeah, I feel it too, Ratty. Davenport’s a used car salesman, but.. I feel it. [FOOTSTEPS.] I don’t know if I’ve got the strength to leave. C’mon, Ratty.</p>

<p>[FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE, THEN STOP. HE OPENS THE TAPE SHELVES, CLOSES THE TAPE SHELVES, AND PLACES THE TAPE IN THE TAPE RECORDER.]</p>

<p>[THE TAPE BEGINS TO PLAY.]</p>

<hr />

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Melody Pendras. May 22nd. 18:29. Floor 5. Could you please say your name for the recorder?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Uh… [CLEARS THROAT, THEN GETS WAY TOO CLOSE TO THE MIC.] Joshua Martinez.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>[CHUCKLING.] Sorry, just a little bit of space between you and the mic.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>[FURTHER BACK NOW.] Yeah, sure. Do you need my name again?</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>No, it’s fine.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Okay.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>So, Joshua, how long have you lived in the Visser building?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>About… five years. Yeah, around five years. Five or six.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>And what made you want to move here?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>I had just graduated from high school, so I was looking for a place to stay, you know? And I was working at the loading dock with Victor. He was looking for a roommate, and he told me about the place. It’s cheap, close to work… yeah, pretty much it.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Give me a sense of what it’s like living in Visser.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>[LAUGHS.] You just wanna know about the freaky shit, am I right?</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, I mean, I’m interested in—</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>I-I’m not angry, okay? Like, I get why.. you’re.. “intrigued”. This place is weird. I know that. Weird stuff is like—sexy, you know? You get, like, fascinated with it. You feel that, don’t you?</p>

<p>[PAUSE.]</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>I need to… answer some questions.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>..Like Jesse Lewis? I heard you were asking about him. Shouting and shit.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>[WITH HOPE.] Do you know where he is?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>No. [CHUCKLES] No, that’s not the point. You don’t get it. I’ve never <em>heard</em> of him, right? But like.. I don’t doubt that something weird happened to him, you know? It’s just… the way Visser is.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>But that’s… I’m sorry, Joshua, you just accept it?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>I mean—okay, like, think about it. Everyone avoids the 8th floor because there’s this gang. Weird gang, but just a gang. Druggy. And there’s a club that’s kind of freaky, and there’s a… how old was Jesse?</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>17.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>There’s a teenager that goes missing. [BEAT.] You know what that sounds like? Like normal New York bullshit. I’m not angry, okay? Visser’s shitty, but everywhere is shitty. My friends are here. Rent’s cheap. Close to work. Like, whatever, you know?</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>[PAUSE, SIGHS.] I’m sorry if I was—</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Nah, I’m not angry, okay? And shit, I believe you with Jesse.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>[PAUSE.]</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Y-You want to try with Victor? Try recording?</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Would you and he be comfortable with that?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Yeah, sure. [AMUSED] You can try. I mean.. it’s the reason you’re talking to me, and Victor always gets a kick out of it.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Is Victor nearby?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Couple doors down.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>I’d appreciate it.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Alright.</p>

<p>[FOOTSTEPS. A DOOR IS OPENED, AND THEY CONTINUE TO TALK AS THEY WALK.]</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Will you be surprised if it doesn’t happen? If I’m able to record him?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>[LAUGHING] I mean, sure, um. You still don’t think it’s going to happen, and—and that’s fine, it’s weird, but just wait.</p>

<p>[HE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR, AND THE AUDIO SUDDENLY BEGINS TO DISTORT.]</p>

<p>Victor! Victor, open up! [HIS VOICE IS OVERWHELMED BY THE TAPE WEIRDNESS, AND THE AUDIO CUTS OUT ABRUPTLY.]</p>

<hr />

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>What? [PAUSE AS DAN CHECKS THE TAPE.] Shit. Looks like someone went over this with a magnet.</p>

<center><p><strong>RATTY</strong></p></center>
<p>[SQUEAKS.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>It’s alright, Ratty, shhh.</p>

<center><p><strong>RATTY</strong></p></center>
<p>[SQUEAKS.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>Okay… Now, Ratty, do you see this? There’s this little smudge on the tape, just a little marking, like an O. I wonder if… [DAN RUMMAGING THROUGH TAPES.] Yeah, there are… there are two more with the same marking. Wanna listen to them, Ratty?</p>

<center><p><strong>RATTY</strong></p></center>
<p>[SQUEAKS.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>I’ll take that as a—I should probably stop talking to you, shouldn’t I?</p>

<p>[HE PUTS THE TAPE IN THE TAPE PLAYER. THE TAPE BEGINS TO PLAY.]</p>

<hr />

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>There.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>[CHUCKLING] Told you.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Melody Pendras, February 12th, 18:38. Floor 5. I didn’t say I—</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Nah, i-it’s alright. Victor’s weird. I mean.. he’s not weird. He’s my friend, he’s a normal guy. We shoot the shit, play Nintendo… he just can’t be filmed, recorded, or anything.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>When did you—when did <em>he</em> find that out?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>School picture day was a shitshow. The photographer always said it was something with the lens or something. After a while, Victor just faked sick on picture day. Easier, you know?</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>And he accepts it?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>I mean, it totally ruined his chances at Hollywood stardom. Dude’s a born actor. He could’ve been the next Marlon Brando.</p>

<p>[PAUSE.]</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Are you—</p>


<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>[LAUGHS.] I had you for a minute. Nah, Victor should have been a bank robber, but he’s not that type of dude. He just rolls with it.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Doesn’t it affect his life?</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>A little. He tells everyone he doesn’t like having his picture taken. But like, nobody’s lining up to do a documentary on Victor Rivera. It’s fine.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>It’s… difficult for me to imagine ever accepting something like that.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>You should talk to him.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>I <em>tried!</em></p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>No, like, just talk to him. Without the recorder. Don’t take notes, just.. talk to the dude.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>I… will. But let me just see if the onboard mic placement might be just the issue. Just as a precaution.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>[LAUGHS. DISTORTION BEGINS, THEN RAMPS UP QUICKLY.] Yo Victor, come closer to the door. [THE TAPE IS AGAIN OVERWHELMED BY STATIC AND ENDS.]</p>

<hr />

<center><p><strong>RATTY</strong></p></center>
<p>[FRENZIED SQUEAKS.]</p>

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I-I’m putting the last one in, don’t worry.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>[HE DOES SO. THE TAPE BEGINS TO PLAY.]</p>

<hr />

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Melody Pendras, February 12th, 20:14. Floor 5.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Victor’s cool, right?</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Yeah, he’s—</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Normal? Yeah, he’s normal. Like, not normal normal because he’s a really good dude. He’d lend you his last forty dollars, and most normal people aren’t that nice. But like, he’s normal.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>I like him.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Yeah, I like him too. [PAUSE.] You still want to—uh, what’d you say? Measure the distance?</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>If Victor doesn’t mind.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Like he said, he’s… he’s cool with it.</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>Alright then.</p>

<center><p><strong>JOSHUA</strong></p></center>
<p>Is this going to, um.. fulfill your curiosity?</p>

<center><p><strong>MELODY</strong></p></center>
<p>[GRINNING AUDIBLY] No, but it’ll be the last recording I try to take off Victor.</p>

<p>[DOOR OPENING, FOOTSTEPS.] 60 feet. 55 feet. 50 feet. 45 feet. [WARPING BEGINS AND PICKS UP QUICKLY.] 40 feet. 35 feet. 30—</p>

<p>[HER VOICE BECOMES INDISTINGUISHABLE, AND THE TAPE CUTS OFF.]</p>

<hr /> 

<center><p><strong>DAN</strong></p></center>
<p>What do you think it is, Ratty? Magnetic fields?</p>

<p>[HEAVILY.] I don’t want to think about stuff like that anymore.</p>

<p>[LONG PAUSE.]</p>

<hr />

<center><p><strong>MARK</strong></p></center>
<p>Hello everyone. So… no new progress on the Dan front. But there have been some troubling attacks on the servers that are hosting this podcast. I keep having to move platforms and, well, that costs money. And I’m really sorry to have to ask you this, but if you want to keep hearing Dan’s story, well, I’m starting a Patreon page for donations. Go to Patreon.com, search Archive 81, and.. if this podcast means anything to you, donations would be really helpful. Thanks, and as always, you can find us on Facebook, Twitter, and our website archive81.com. And.. if you know anything about Dan, well—you know how to contact us.</p>
