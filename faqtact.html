      <center><p style="font-size:32px"><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></p></center>
  <p><strong>Why create an unofficial transcript?</strong></p>
  <p>Considering there's a public and official one I linked to on the disclaimer page, this is a super fair question! And I do genuinely appreciate that Dead Signals has been releasing transcripts in any form—it's incredible!</p>
  <p>However, it's an issue of both accessibility and functionality for me: the official transcripts aren't really transcripts. They're rough draft scripts written preproduction. So the stuff that's in there doesn't fully reflect what's in the final episodes—there are sections added/taken away, different wording, SFX that didn't make the final cut, and so forth. That means anybody using the transcripts because they have issues with following along with the audio isn't going to get the best experience. There are also sometimes spoilers in the official transcripts' SFX cues which might suck for first time listeners!</p>
  <p>Also, and this is much more shallow, accessible and accurate transcripts are super convenient from a fan perspective, so here I am.</p>
  <p><strong>How are the transcripts created?</strong></p>
  <p>I reference the original scripts released by Dead Signals and relisten to the episodes line by line 'til I've gotten all the differences down. The SFX cues are Frankensteined together from what's written in the official transcripts and from what the effects sound like to me. Like I said, the typed cues do tend to differ to some degree from what's in the episode. Because of the way I do this, the whole job's pretty subjective! Hence the contact info in case you've got a bone to pick. I promise I won't mind!</p>
  <p><strong>What software do you use?</strong></p>
  <p>All the formatting is done via HTML on CodePen, and the site itself is hosted on GitHub. Don't hesitate to tell me if there's an issue in the code itself—I'm just teaching myself HTML as I go, so I'm super open to any constructive criticism!</p>
    <p><strong>Is this project dead?</strong></p>
    <p>It is not! Kind of. I started the Unofficial Transcript Project in summer of 2020, when I had a wealth of time and motivation. I more or less fell off the wagon in autumn 2020, my first semester of college. Now it's November of 2022, and I'm giving it another shot. But I have a life, so the update schedule of this site depends entirely on how motivated I am at any given moment and whether or not I have time to execute on that motivation. So I'll do my best, but like, ya know, don't hold your breath. If you have an episode request, send it in! I'm transcribing whatever episode the urge strikes me for.</p>
  <p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
  <p>I'm Allen, a 20-year-old college student! The whole college student thing is definitely causing delays in this whole process (oh to go back to August 2020 when I was uploading two a day), but I'm doing my best to get these things up as soon as possible regardless, and I appreciate everyone's patience on that front! As of the time I'm writing this, all these transcripts have been entirely done by me. Same goes for the website. I'll add credits in the proper places as I go on!</p>
