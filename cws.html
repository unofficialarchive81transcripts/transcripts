  <center><p style="font-size:32px"><strong>ABOUT THE CONTENT WARNINGS</strong></p></center>
  
  <p><strong>Why have content warnings?</strong></p>
  <p>I've added broad content warnings to the beginning to each episode hidden under a drop-down thingie. I did that so that people who are concerned about what they may be getting themselves into content-wise can check them and so that those who are unconcerned about it can skip the warnings easily.</p>
  <p>The pros of content warnings is that you, as a reader/listener, have the option of gauging what's right for you. If you're worried the content will be too much, you have the option to skip the episode entirely or just read the transcript.</p>
    <p>More likely, though, you'll read the warnings, decide you can deal, and will be ready for more potentially sensitive stuff when it happens. Sometimes just knowing something unpleasant is coming and being prepared for it can make the difference between Hearing Something Unpleasant and Your Whole Day Getting Ruined!</p>
  <p>The cons, of course, are that spoilers are inevitably going to happen. I keep them as vague as possible for that reason, but please be aware that there's definitely a risk of spoilers!</p>
<p>If some of these content warnings seem like reaches or overreactions to you, that's fine! Frankly, I didn't check any content warnings myself as I went through my first listen, and I was okay. But in the end, I'd rather that people were comfortable. I vastly prefer 100 people rolling their eyes at content warnings to 1 person having a horrible experience because they weren't prepared to hear, say, animal death or sexual harassment or dehumanization or somebody getting nonconsensual surgery done on them. Or something more outwardly innocuous that they happen to be sensitive to!</p>
  <p><strong>Where are these content warnings coming from?</strong></p>
  <p>Partially from my own head, but mostly from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3l99KOgjwIO2SBPQuzZmz4cGjMhz8RaAxvfLrwj81s/edit">[this]</a> extensive community Google Doc run by <a href="https://kaamos-mu.tumblr.com/">@kaamos-mu</a> on Tumblr, which also clarifies some of the terminology used in the warnings (e.g. "described" vs "implied" vs "soundscaped" and so forth) if you're looking for that! It has a more exhaustive list as well, so if you're concerned about more specific stuff you can check in there rather than under the spoiler warning on the transcripts. You can also contact me if you think there's something that should be added. I try to keep the content warnings as concise as I can, focusing on more general/common triggers, but this specific task is inherently <strong>extremely subjective,</strong> so it's more than possible that I'll miss something major.</p>

<p><strong>Throughout the podcast, there's a lot of swearing, some sexual references, themes concerning the shitty reality of capitalism (including classism, ableism, racism, colonialism, etc), and cosmic horror (because this is a cosmic horror podcast). There's also constant surveillance (just by dint of it being found footage format) and mentions of cults. You can't really avoid this stuff! So know that going in, and if this brand of content has a major negative effect on your emotional state, this might just end up being a podcast you skip.</p>
