  <p><strong>Why have content warnings?</strong></p>
  <p>I've added content warnings to the beginning to each episode hidden under a drop-down thingie. I did that so that people who are concerned about what they may be getting themselves into content-wise can check them and so that those who are unconcerned about it can skip the warnings easily.</p>
  <p>The pros of content warnings is that you, as a reader/listener, have the option of gauging what's right for you. If you're worried the content will be too much, you now have the option to skip the episode entirely or just read the transcript.</p>
    <p>More likely, though, you'll read the warnings, decide you can deal, and will be ready for more potentially sensitive stuff when it happens. Sometimes just knowing something unpleasant is coming and being prepared for it can make the difference between Hearing Something Unpleasant and Your Whole Day Getting Ruined!</p>
  <p>The cons, of course, are that spoilers are inevitably going to happen. I keep them as vague as possible for that reason, but please be aware that there's definitely a risk of spoilers!</p>
<p>If some of these content warnings seem like reaches or overreactions to you, that's fine! Frankly, I didn't check any content warnings myself as I went through my first listen, and I was okay. But in the end, I'd rather that people were comfortable. I vastly prefer 100 people rolling their eyes at content warnings to 1 person having a horrible experience because they weren't prepared to hear, say, animal death or sexual harassment or dehumanization or somebody getting nonconsensual surgery done on them. Or something more outwardly innocuous that they happen to be sensitive to!</p>
  <p><strong>Where are these content warnings coming from?</strong></p>
  <p>Partially from my own head, but mostly from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3l99KOgjwIO2SBPQuzZmz4cGjMhz8RaAxvfLrwj81s/edit">[this]</a> extensive community Google Doc run by <a href="https://kaamos-mu.tumblr.com/">@kaamos-mu</a> on Tumblr, which also clarifies some of the terminology used in the warnings (e.g. "described" vs "implied" vs "soundscaped" and so forth) if you're looking for that! You can also contact me if you want a warning added to a transcript specifically.</p>

<p><strong>SERIES-WIDE CONTENT WARNINGS:</strong> Throughout the podcast, there's a lot of swearing, a fair amount of sexual references, references to the shitty reality of capitalism, and cosmic horror (because this is a horror podcast). There's no avoiding any of it! So know that going in.</p>
<p><strong>SEASON ONE CONTENT WARNINGS:</strong> Constant surveillance, cult activity, isolation.</p>
<p><strong>SEASON TWO CONTENT WARNINGS:</strong> Body horror, general loss of autonomy, constant surveillance, overtones of colonialism.</p>
<p><strong>SEASON THREE CONTENT WARNINGS:</strong> Soundscaped vomiting. Really just, like, a whole lot of it. Also background cult stuff going on.
